# TP-ISO-Patcher
A program used to patch a TP ISO with custom files, including the Randomizer

## Usage - Releases
Grab the latest release from the `Releases` page of the project.
- Randomizer
-- Take your generated seeds and place them into the `_seeds` folder located in `PatchFiles\RandoFiles\_seeds`

- General TP Files
-- Take the files you want to patch into the ISO and place them in the `PatchFiles\GameFiles` folder. 
--- Make sure that the structure of the files copied match the file structure of the files you want to overwrite, so for example if you want to replace `res\Object\Alink.arc` then you will want to place it in `PatchFiles\GameFiles\res\Object\Alink.arc`
